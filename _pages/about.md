I'm a postdoc at Cornell University, working in the [Laboratory of Neurobiology of Learning and Memory](https://blogs.cornell.edu/davidsmithlab/) with Prof. David Smith.

Prior to this, I completed my PhD work in the [AMP Lab](https://amp-lab.psych.cornell.edu) under the supervision of Prof. Khena Swallow. Before that, I was a research trainee at the Harvard Medical School (working on how auditory cues guide visual search), a visiting student research collaborator at Princeton (studying people's willingness to exert effort and its relationship to how they balance model-based versus model-free reinforcement learning), and I completed my B.Sc. and M.Sc. at Leiden University in the Netherlands. Since 2017, I have also been the assistant curator of Cornell's famous [Wilder Brain Collection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilder_Brain_Collection), a volunteer position through which I regularly organize science outreach events for kids and adolescents in upstate New York.

My Research
============
A longstanding idea in behavioral and brain sciences is that our perception, attention, and memory are limited and fallible. And yet, despite our limitations, we are able to adapt our moment-to-moment decision-making effectively. How does the brain manage our limited resources and somehow still produce highly adaptive and skilled behavior? My research aims to provide a comprehensive description of the psychological, computational, and neurobiological mechanisms underpinning how perception, attention, memory, and decision-making systems handle dynamic, eventful, multisensory environments to produce adaptive behavior.

As Kurt Lewin said, “Nothing is as practical as a good theory” and I utilize theories from event cognition and multisensory integration to study the aforementioned paradox between limitations of the mind and expertise in behavior. Objects & their perceptual features, agents and their actions, as well as any implied relationships between them constitute "features of events" that the mind seems to integrate into a coherent representation that allows for efficient cognition and flexible decision-making.

Because I investigate dynamic cognitive processes, my work crosses traditional research boundaries and requires a diverse methodological approach, including research with both human and non-human subjects (e.g. rodents), to collect rich datasets of behavioral measures, physiological measures (e.g. eyetracking & pupillometry), and neuroimaging measures (e.g. fMRI, EEG/LFP, neural spikes) and manipulations (optogenetics). I then utilize various model-based/computational neuroscience methods to elucidate mechanisms in those data, such as sequential evidence accumulation models (e.g. drift-diffusion models, linear ballistic accumulators) or reinforcement learning models (e.g. model-based versus model-free learning trade-offs). Finally, I care about ecological and naturalistic behavior as much as I do about the fundamental computational properties of single neurons and so I emphasize a balanced utilization of highly controlled paradigms (such as head-fixed rodents) and neural recordings during free & self-directed behavioral paradigms.
      
All this highlights my personal belief that the most creative and innovative research takes place at the intersection of topics and methods that have historically remained separated. By placing the focus on overarching theories of ecological and adaptive behavior, first and foremost, I try to generate interesting research questions about neural mechanisms and then employ the best tools to answer those questions, rather than having our available tools guide the questions we ask.
