I am a postdoc at Cornell University in the [Laboratory of Neurobiology of Learning and Memory](https://blogs.cornell.edu/davidsmithlab/) led by Prof. David Smith, but moving to University College London for a research fellow position this Fall!

Prior to this, I completed my PhD work in the [AMP Lab](https://amp-lab.psych.cornell.edu) under the supervision of Prof. Khena Swallow at Cornell. I have also worked as a research trainee at the Harvard Medical School (studying how auditory cues impact visual search), as a visiting student research collaborator at Princeton (studying the relationship between cognitive effort and model-based versus model-free reinforcement learning), and as a research assistant at Leiden University supported through the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts & Sciences (studying the developmental trajectory of decision-making mechanisms in the brain in childhood and adolescence). Since 2017, I have also been the assistant curator of Cornell's famous [Wilder Brain Collection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilder_Brain_Collection), a volunteer position through which I regularly organize science outreach events for kids and adolescents in upstate New York.

The Wilder Brain Collection has been showcased at many outreach events, including Upward Bound, Expanding Your Horizons, Brain Days, Kids Science Day, GRASSHOPR, and the Community Neuroscience Initiative!


My Research
============
A longstanding idea in behavioral and brain sciences is that our perception, attention, and memory are limited and fallible. And yet, despite our limitations, we can effectively get through the day. How does the brain manage its limited resources to somehow still produce highly adaptive and skilled behavior? **My research aims to provide a comprehensive description of the psychological, computational, and neurobiological mechanisms underpinning (i) how incoming multisensory information is processed, integrated, and transformed into coherent representations of the environment, (ii) how it is decided which information gets represented on the so-called "cognitive map", and (iii) how context-appropriate memories are retrieved to flexibly guide context-dependent behavior.**

As Kurt Lewin said, “Nothing is as practical as a good theory” and **I utilize theories from event processing, multisensory cognition, and on interactions between attention & memory** to study the aforementioned paradox between limitations of the mind and expertise in behavior. Objects & their perceptual features, agents and their actions, as well as any implied relationships between them constitute "features of events" that the mind seems to integrate into a coherent representation that allows for efficient cognition and flexible decision-making.

Because I investigate dynamic cognitive processes, **my work crosses traditional research boundaries and requires a diverse methodological approach**. I do research with both human subjects and rodents, collecting rich datasets with ecological behavior, neuroimaging (fMRI, EEG/LFP, neural spikes), physiology (e.g. eyetracking & pupillometry), and invasive manipulations (optogenetics). I then utilize various model-based/computational neuroscience methods to elucidate mechanisms in those data, such as sequential evidence accumulation models (e.g. drift-diffusion models, linear ballistic accumulators) or reinforcement learning models (e.g. model-based versus model-free learning trade-offs). Importantly, I care about ecological and naturalistic behavior as much as I do about the fundamental computational properties of single neurons and so I emphasize a balanced utilization of highly controlled paradigms (such as head-fixed rodents) and neural recordings of animals during free & self-guided behavior.
      
All this highlights my personal belief that the most creative and innovative research takes place at the intersection of topics and methods that have historically remained separated. By placing the focus on overarching theories of ecological and adaptive behavior, first and foremost, I try to generate interesting research questions about neural mechanisms and then employ the best tools to answer those questions, rather than having our available tools guide the questions we ask.
