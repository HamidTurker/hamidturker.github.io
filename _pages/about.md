I'm a Ph.D. candidate at Cornell University, working the [AMP Lab](https://amp-lab.psych.cornell.edu) under the supervision of Prof. Khena Swallow.


My Research
============
A longstanding idea in brain and behavioral sciences is that attention and memory are limited and fallible. Yet, despite their limitations, we are able to adapt our moment-to-moment behavior effectively. My research aims to provide a comprehensive description of the psychological, computational, and neurobiological mechanisms underpinning how attention and memory systems handle dynamic, eventful environments to produce adaptive behavior. Because I investigate multiple
cognitive processes, my work crosses traditional research boundaries and requires a diverse methodological approach, including behavioral measures, fMRI, EEG, pupillometry, and computational modeling. This also highlights my personal belief that the most creative and innovative research takes place at the intersection of topics and methods that have historically remained separated.
