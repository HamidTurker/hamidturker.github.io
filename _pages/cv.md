In Brief
======
I currently work as a postdoctoral associate in the lab of David Smith. Prior to this, I completed my PhD work in the [AMP Lab](https://amp-lab.psych.cornell.edu) under the supervision of Prof. Khena Swallow at Cornell. I have also worked as a research trainee at the Harvard Medical School (studying how auditory cues impact visual search), as a visiting student research collaborator at Princeton (studying the relationship between cognitive effort and model-based versus model-free reinforcement learning), and as a research assistant at Leiden University supported through the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts & Sciences (studying the developmental trajectory of decision-making mechanisms in the brain in childhood and adolescence). Since 2017, I have also been the assistant curator of Cornell's famous [Wilder Brain Collection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilder_Brain_Collection), a volunteer position through which I regularly organize science outreach events for kids and adolescents in upstate New York.
